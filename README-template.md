## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

During this project I learned that I can bring a simple design to life. This was my first project that I worked on entirely by myself outside of my Skillcrush Frontend Bootcamp. 

I learned that consistency in my actions makes a difference and that updates to the HTML happen while configuring the CSS. 


### Continued development

I want to continue to develop my flexbox skills, specicially flex-basis and grow as I'm not quite comfortable with those yet. I'd also like to work on CSS grid, but that's outside the scope of this particular project.
